URLShort

A simple demonstration of fig orchestration in the form of a URL bookmark / shortening service.

service/ contains the cherrypy-based service.

database/ contains the schema and simple script for setting up a docker instance for the database.
Note that the schema is oddly formatted to work within the postgres --single environment.
